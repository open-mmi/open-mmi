# Validation and custom editing

## Validation layers

Validation is shared by catalogue inspection, draft save, preview, coordinator apply,
CLI commands and tests.

It has four layers:

1. JSON and document shape;
2. profile or bindings semantic validation;
3. profile/bindings compatibility; and
4. runtime/provisioning validation.

The privileged coordinator reruns every validation required for application.

## Profile validation

At minimum validate:

- top-level object;
- `default_bus` string;
- `can_buses` object when present;
- default bus exists or receives the documented legacy fallback;
- each bus metadata value is an object;
- interface names have valid bounded Linux syntax;
- bitrate is a positive bounded integer when present;
- provisioning is from an allowlist;
- `bring_up` is boolean when present;
- rule, presence and status collections are arrays;
- CAN identifiers parse and are in the supported range;
- byte indexes and masks are valid for the supported frame type;
- rule bus references exist;
- event identifiers are canonical entries in the Open MMI vehicle-event registry;
- `value: "any"` rules match the registered payload contract and exact-value rules use no-payload events;
- presence transitions use registered no-payload events;
- status paths are non-empty bounded strings;
- supported status rule types contain their required fields; and
- aliases do not create ambiguous output without an explicit warning.

Unknown fields may be warnings during alpha compatibility, but fields used to generate
privileged configuration must be strict.

## Bindings validation

Bindings currently identify a module and function dynamically. UI editing requires an
explicit action registry before a bindings document is considered safe for visual
editing.

The registry defines:

- stable action identifier;
- display name and description;
- implementation callable;
- allowed argument count and types;
- default arguments;
- whether extra CAN-derived arguments are accepted; and
- whether the action is exposed to custom bindings.

Bindings validation then checks:

- top-level event map;
- canonical registered vehicle-event keys;
- registered action identifier;
- bounded argument arrays;
- argument types and values; and
- no unsupported extra fields.

The vehicle-event registry is already authoritative for binding keys. The runtime may retain
a compatibility reader for existing `module` and `func` action fields, but newly saved UI
bindings should eventually resolve action implementations through the separate action registry.

## Compatibility validation

Compare events emitted by profile rules and presence transitions with binding keys.

Report:

- emitted and bound;
- emitted but unbound;
- bound but not emitted;
- duplicate event definitions;
- actions requiring dynamic arguments that the rule cannot provide; and
- profile entries referencing undeclared buses.

Unbound events are normally warnings. Invalid action definitions are errors.

## Runtime validation

Preview validates:

- selected active bus is declared or is a documented legacy default;
- exactly one bus is active in V1;
- selected interface name is valid;
- one interface is not assigned ambiguously;
- generated udev configuration uses parsed values rather than caller text; and
- the selected source revisions still match catalogue revisions.

Interface absence is a warning, not an error.

## Custom-copy provenance

Creating a custom copy uses the installed maintained template. It never uses a mutable
checkout unless explicit development mode is active.

Store provenance in a sidecar file which the daemon does not parse:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "profile",
  "id": "my-seat",
  "display_name": "My Seat",
  "template": {
    "source": "maintained",
    "id": "seat_1p",
    "open_mmi_version": "v1-foundation-alpha-…",
    "revision": "sha256:…"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-07-19T12:00:00+00:00"
}
```

The sidecar supports later comparison. It does not authorize automatic merging.

The implemented copy route stores these private sidecars under
`~/.config/open-mmi/.open-mmi-provenance/<kind>/<id>.json`. The daemon never scans this
hidden tree. Profile data remains under `vehicles/<id>/config.json`; bindings data
remains under `bindings/<id>.json`. Maintained files are never opened for writing.

## JSON import

The dashboard can import a local `.json` file only as a new `custom` identity. The browser
sends the selected kind, a validated identifier and bounded JSON text; it never sends a
filesystem path. The backend parses with duplicate-key and non-finite-number rejection,
runs the same full profile or bindings validator used by catalogue discovery, and uses
private no-overwrite creation. Invalid content, an existing identifier or an untrusted
custom directory leaves no imported item behind.

Imported content is selected as an unapplied draft. It does not restart `canbusd`, alter
maintained content, or replace any existing custom item. Import provenance records the
creation origin separately from maintained-template provenance.

## Draft loading and saving

Loading returns:

- kind and identifier;
- exact UTF-8 JSON content;
- content revision; and
- validation result.

Saving requires the revision returned by load. A changed revision produces a conflict
instead of overwriting another browser or terminal edit.

Save sequence:

1. validate identifier and fixed root;
2. reject symlinks and non-regular targets;
3. compare expected content revision;
4. parse and validate submitted JSON;
5. verify the target identity has not changed during the save;
6. write and flush a private temporary sibling file;
7. atomically replace the draft and flush its directory; and
8. return the new revision, validation result and `applied: false`.

The current editor rejects invalid JSON and semantic validation errors before writing.
Saving never restarts `canbusd` and never changes maintained content or provenance.
For coordinator-managed exact document paths, the running daemon pins its successfully
parsed profile and bindings revisions until restart; periodic and SIGHUP reloads cannot
activate a saved draft. Activation remains a separate reviewed operation. Last-known-good
user revision archives remain a later slice.

## Custom lifecycle operations

Duplicate, rename and delete are available only for fixed `custom` identities and
require the exact current content revision. They never accept a path or document body.
All three operations acquire the shared lifecycle lock so they cannot race a reviewed
apply or managed update.

- Duplicate is allowed for active or inactive custom items because it leaves the source
  untouched and creates a new private destination.
- Rename is allowed only for inactive custom items. It moves the exact profile directory
  or bindings file, moves and updates provenance, and never changes the content revision.
- Delete is allowed only for inactive custom items and requires explicit browser
  confirmation. The backend hides the exact item under a private temporary name before
  removing its content and provenance.
- Existing destination identifiers, stale revisions, unsafe permissions, symlinks, hard
  links, unsupported profile-directory contents and active identities fail closed.
- Lifecycle operations return `applied: false`; selection and activation remain a
  separate reviewed workflow.

Maintained entries never expose Edit, Duplicate, Rename or Delete. Their only custom
entry point remains **Use maintained … as template**, which creates a separate copy.

## Editor delivery order

1. Advanced JSON text editing with syntax and semantic validation.
2. Structured profile overview and bus metadata.
3. Registry-backed event-to-action bindings matrix.
4. Structured presence and event rule tables.
5. Structured status-rule editors per rule type.
6. Optional recorded-frame assistance as a later research feature.

A full status-rule editor is not a prerequisite for maintained profile selection or
custom bindings selection.

## Sacred-file rules

- Updates never overwrite, refresh, migrate or delete custom profile/bindings content.
- Apply never copies maintained content over an existing custom identifier.
- Returning to maintained clears explicit custom selection but leaves custom files
  untouched.
- Template updates may produce a comparison notice only.
- Any future migration of custom content is an explicit, previewed user action.
