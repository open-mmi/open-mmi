# Maintained vehicle-profile standard

A maintained Open MMI vehicle profile is more than a decoder that happens to load. It is a
versioned, reviewable compatibility claim about a real vehicle family.

> **This is an admission and continuity checkpoint, not a walled garden.**
>
> Raw CAN discovery, notes, captures and custom profiles remain open. No contributor needs
> permission to investigate a vehicle. The extra requirements begin only when a profile is
> proposed for the maintained catalogue distributed by Open MMI.

The standard answers four user-facing questions:

1. **What vehicle is this profile for?**
2. **How mature is the integration?**
3. **What exactly has been tested?**
4. **Where is the reviewable evidence?**

The machine-readable envelope is described by
`canbusd/data/vehicle-profile.v1.schema.json`. Registry and decoder semantics remain enforced
by the normal profile validator.

## Required envelope

A maintained profile starts with:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "id": "seat_1p",
    "display_name": "SEAT Leon 1P",
    "manufacturer": "SEAT",
    "model": "Leon",
    "generation": "1P",
    "platform": "VAG PQ35",
    "model_years": {
      "from": 2005,
      "to": 2012
    },
    "maturity": "qualified",
    "license": "GPL-3.0-only",
    "maintainers": [
      "Open MMI contributors"
    ],
    "qualification": {
      "level": "hardware",
      "last_tested": "2026-07-20",
      "scope": [
        "Passive comfort CAN reception at 100 kbit/s"
      ],
      "evidence": [
        {
          "kind": "hardware",
          "path": "docs/design/v1-vehicle-setup/qualification.md",
          "description": "Maintainer hardware qualification record."
        }
      ]
    },
    "limitations": [
      "Only the comfort CAN bus is qualified."
    ]
  },
  "default_bus": "comfort",
  "can_buses": {},
  "rules": [],
  "presence": [],
  "status": []
}
```

`metadata.id` must match the directory under `vehicles/`. Evidence paths are repository-relative
and must resolve to regular files in the same source tree.

## Maturity levels

| Maturity | Meaning | Minimum evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `experimental` | Useful maintained work whose interpretation or coverage is still changing. | Qualification may be `none`; limitations must remain honest. |
| `candidate` | Canonical semantics and deterministic testing are ready for broader qualification. | Replay or hardware qualification and corresponding evidence. |
| `qualified` | The stated scope has passed real-vehicle hardware testing. | Hardware qualification, date, scope and at least one hardware evidence record. |
| `deprecated` | Retained for migration or historical compatibility. | Existing evidence remains visible; replacement guidance belongs in limitations/docs. |

A profile maturity label describes the overall integration. Individual status registry entries
may still be `experimental` or `diagnostic`, and those limitations must not be presented as
fully stable capabilities.

## Qualification levels

- `none` — no formal replay or hardware claim; `last_tested` is `null` and scope/evidence are empty.
- `replay` — deterministic captures or fixtures were replayed; the tested scope and evidence are named.
- `hardware` — the stated scope was tested on a real vehicle; the date and hardware evidence are named.

Evidence kinds are `research`, `capture`, `replay`, `hardware`, and `documentation`.

## One admission command

Check the complete maintained catalogue from a source checkout:

```bash
open-mmi-config vehicle-setup conform --root .
```

Check one profile:

```bash
open-mmi-config vehicle-setup conform --root . seat_1p
```

The command verifies:

- the versioned metadata envelope;
- directory and profile identity agreement;
- maturity/qualification consistency;
- evidence paths and files;
- CAN bus metadata and decoder structure;
- canonical event and status contracts;
- a capability inventory derived from the profile rather than handwritten claims.

CI runs the same complete-catalogue command. A failed report blocks admission to the maintained
catalogue; it does not block discovery notes or local custom-profile use.

## Contribution path

```text
Raw CAN discovery
        ↓
Custom/provisional decoder
        ↓
Canonical events and statuses
        ↓
Replay or hardware evidence
        ↓
Maintained-profile conformance report
        ↓
Catalogue review
```

A contributor may add the metadata, evidence and first profile implementation in the same pull
request. There is no separate permission request or private allow-list.
