# Trust architecture

Open MMI's trust architecture is intended to make changes to privacy, vehicle-control,
network, and persistence boundaries explicit and reviewable. It is not a claim that the
current Nightly already enforces every boundary at the operating-system or hardware layer.

The first implementation is **Trust Manifest v1**. It names the current boundaries in a
strict machine-readable form and records the strength of the current control separately
from the policy itself.

## Core rule

A release may declare what it wants to do. A release must not be able to authorize its own
expansion of an owner's previously accepted trust boundary.

Update continuity keeps three concepts separate:

1. **Release Trust Manifest** — supplied by the candidate release; describes proposed
   capabilities and their assurance level.
2. **Accepted owner trust state** — retained by the already-trusted installation; records
   what the owner has accepted.
3. **Transition history** — records explicit boundary transitions so lineage can later be
   checked independently.

Trust Manifest v1 establishes the release declaration, Accepted Owner Trust State v1
establishes the second local authority record, Trust Transition Gate v1 enforces the comparison
before a prepared candidate receives privileged execution, Trust Transition Lineage v1 records
accepted-state changes from a locally confirmed genesis baseline forward, Installed Release/File
Integrity v1 binds active installed runtime bytes to the exact accepted Git candidate, and Release
Provenance / Pinned Signer Root v1 lets old trusted code authenticate current and future candidate
commit signatures against an owner-established OpenPGP primary key. The repository also ships an
independent trust checker and a separate independent CAN topology/challenge checker. They do not
import the target Open MMI Python package and keep their conclusions separate from the installed
Inspector. They remain software evidence: neither path is hardware attestation or an immutable
off-device anchor merely because it is independently implemented.

## Evidence scope is part of the result

Trust Inspector status is intentionally not a one-bit claim that every declared
boundary was observed live. Each check carries additive evidence metadata inside
its existing `evidence` object. A check can name one or more evidence scopes, so
a result that compares reviewed source with deployed configuration does not have
to pretend those are the same thing. New readers can distinguish declared
policy, local owner authority, installed byte integrity, cryptographic
provenance, reviewed static contracts, bounded runtime self-tests, and deployed
configuration. Older v1 readers may ignore those extra evidence keys; newer
readers treat missing legacy observation metadata as unspecified, never as
evidence that an observation did or did not occur.

`PASS` therefore means the check succeeded **within its stated evidence scope**.
A static/deployed-configuration PASS does not claim that a namespace, qdisc,
firewall, network path, storage mediation, or hardware boundary was observed
live. Capability enforcement checks additionally retain `PASS` / `FAIL` /
`UNVERIFIED` independently across four evidence dimensions: declared policy,
static contract, runtime enforcement, and hardware qualification. A static
contract can therefore be `PASS` while runtime enforcement and hardware
qualification remain visibly `UNVERIFIED`; unavailable evidence is not hidden
behind the static result. Overall report status aggregates both check statuses
and these capability-dimension statuses: any dimension `FAIL` dominates, and
otherwise any `UNVERIFIED` dimension prevents an overall `PASS`. The local
Inspector does not claim hardware observation. Live CAN namespace,
egress-DROP, one-way-gateway, controller
identity, receive-counter and challenge evidence belongs to the separate
independent CAN trust test.

The privileged dashboard coordinator remains AF_UNIX-only and read-only. It does
not gain `NET_ADMIN`, enter the vehicle network namespace, or mutate the machine
to turn static evidence into a green runtime claim.

## Current v1 capabilities

The checked manifest lives at:

```text
open_mmi_trust/data/trust-manifest.v1.json
```

It declares these stable capability identifiers:

- `vehicle.can.receive`
- `vehicle.can.transmit`
- `telemetry.collection`
- `vehicle.identity.remote-resolution`
- `network.external-egress`
- `vehicle-data.persistence`

Capability identifiers are compatibility contracts. A later schema must not silently reuse
an existing identifier with a materially different meaning.

## Policy and assurance are different

The manifest records both:

- **policy** — what the release says is permitted;
- **assurance** — how strongly the current release can demonstrate that policy.

Trust Manifest v1 defines these assurance levels:

```text
declared
ci-guarded
runtime-guarded
os-enforced
hardware-enforced
```

A stronger policy statement does not magically create stronger enforcement. In policy
generation 6, `telemetry.collection` remains `runtime-guarded` and `vehicle.can.receive`
remains `ci-guarded`; `network.external-egress`, `vehicle-data.persistence` and
`vehicle.can.transmit` are declared `os-enforced`, while
`vehicle.identity.remote-resolution` is `runtime-guarded`. Those assurance values describe
the declared control layer, not the provenance of every observation. A Trust Inspector PASS
for a reviewed or deployed OS contract does not by itself mean the effective runtime boundary
was observed live, and no software-only inspection is silently promoted to hardware
qualification.

Removing an established enforcement layer is itself trust-relevant even if the headline
policy text does not change.

## Telemetry Guard v1

Trust policy generation 2 is the first declared capability expansion after the manifest
foundation. `telemetry.collection` changes from `prohibited` to `local-owner-opt-in`; the
release does not authorize collection merely by declaring that policy.

Generation 2 originally landed before Accepted Owner Trust State and Trust Transition Gate
v1 existed, so that historical generation-1 to generation-2 installation was not pre-screened
by the gate. Accepted Owner Trust State v1 can bootstrap the currently trusted installed
boundary, but it deliberately cannot retroactively prove that the historical installation was
gated. Future prepared candidates are now compared with accepted owner state before candidate
root execution. Actual telemetry sampling remains independently denied until the separate
local Telemetry Guard authorization boundary succeeds.

Telemetry Guard v1 is deliberately narrow:

- missing, unreadable, malformed, permission-weakened, wrong-VIN or wrong-scope
  authorization state denies collection;
- the supported owner mutation surface is an interactive local-terminal command; it has
  no HTTP endpoint, non-interactive confirmation flag or VIN command-line argument. The
  production state directory is root-owned mode `0700` and its state file is mode `0600`;
- the raw VIN is never written to authorization state. A random salt and PBKDF2-SHA256
  fingerprint bind authorization to the locally supplied 17-character VIN;
- authorization stores the exact normalized scope plus its SHA-256 digest. Any purpose or
  signal change produces a different digest and therefore requires new owner authorization;
- Telemetry Guard v1 accepts only `retention: session` and `destination: local-only`. It
  cannot authorize durable telemetry storage or remote submission;
- `collect_with_guard()` requires one sampler per declared signal, rejects missing or extra
  samplers, and evaluates authorization before invoking any sampler, so a denied request does
  not first collect data and discard it later.

The production state is `/var/lib/open-mmi/trust/telemetry-authorization.v1.json`. The local
owner CLI is `open-mmi-telemetry` and production mutation requires root. There is
intentionally no HTTP authorization endpoint and no remote VIN lookup. CI also rejects
production calls to the authorization mutation primitives outside the owner CLI.

A scope file is explicit data, for example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "purpose": "owner-diagnostics",
  "signals": ["vehicle.rpm", "vehicle.speed"],
  "retention": "session",
  "destination": "local-only"
}
```

The owner can review and authorize that exact file locally with:

```text
sudo open-mmi-telemetry authorize --scope ./telemetry-scope.json
```

Revocation is similarly local and interactive:

```text
sudo open-mmi-telemetry revoke
```

Generation 2 does not add a background telemetry collector or uploader. It establishes the
authorization boundary that any future built-in collector must pass before sampling.

The manifest's `runtime-guarded` assurance describes this Open MMI collection boundary, not
an OS sandbox against arbitrary root code. Future built-in collectors must use the guard; a
future OS-level egress/persistence architecture can make bypass materially harder.

## Operational processing is not telemetry

Open MMI must process local vehicle and host state to provide requested functionality. That
includes values such as speed, RPM, temperatures, door state, media state, trip counters,
and service-reminder state.

For this architecture, **telemetry collection** means collecting or retaining observations
for analytics, profiling, product metrics, fleet statistics, usage measurement, diagnostic
reporting, remote submission, or similar secondary measurement purposes.

Using a value transiently or persisting a narrowly declared local operational state for the
feature the owner requested is not automatically telemetry. Changing the purpose of that
collection is trust-relevant.

## Networking

Open MMI is local-first, not network-free. Policy generation 6 declares external egress
only for these named purposes:

- Internet Radio;
- Jellyfin;
- release/update retrieval.

Normal dashboard rendering must not introduce a third-party network dependency. Bootstrap
5.3.8 is therefore vendored as a local static asset and verified against Bootstrap's
published SHA-384 Subresource Integrity digest. The previously loaded Bootstrap Icons
stylesheet was unnecessary because Open MMI's media controls already use inline SVG icons,
so that dependency was removed rather than copied locally.

This removes the former `frontend.bootstrap-cdn` and `frontend.bootstrap-icons-cdn` purposes
from `network.external-egress`. It is the first recorded example of the trust boundary
becoming narrower after Trust Manifest v1: the dashboard keeps the same declared feature
set while surrendering two unrelated third-party egress paths. Generation 6 declares this
capability `os-enforced`. The local Inspector can compare the reviewed source contract with
the root-owned deployed service configuration, but that scoped PASS does not directly
observe effective network traffic. Effective isolation and any external measurement remain
separate evidence rather than being inferred from unit-file text.

## Vehicle CAN

The current project posture remains passive observation first. Policy generation 6 declares
`vehicle.can.receive` allowed with `ci-guarded` assurance and `vehicle.can.transmit`
prohibited with `os-enforced` assurance. Production `canbusd` still has no transmit action.

The production topology places the physical `canN` inside the fixed private CAN namespace,
exports receive traffic one way through `openmmi-rxp`/`openmmi-rx`, and requires exact egress
DROP barriers on both the private physical interface and the host receive proxy. The physical
controller is deliberately not required to be `LISTEN-ONLY`, so ACK-capable reception remains
possible without giving Open MMI a CAN transmit surface.

Trust Inspector validates the reviewed source, deployed unit/udev and privilege contracts but
does not claim that it observed the live namespace, qdiscs, filters, gateway, controller or
current traffic. The separate P02 independent CAN checker performs that read-only live
measurement, including namespace identity, vxcan peers, exact dual DROP rules, one-way gateway,
controller/driver identity and positive passive receive counters. That independent runtime
evidence is still not hardware attestation.

## Accepted Owner Trust State v1

Accepted Owner Trust State v1 is the local authority record that is deliberately separate
from a release-supplied Trust Manifest. Its production state is:

```text
/var/lib/open-mmi/trust/accepted-owner-trust.v1.json
```

The final directory is root-owned mode `0700`; the state file is root-owned mode `0600`,
written atomically and validated strictly. The record contains the exact normalized accepted
Trust Manifest, its deterministic SHA-256 digest and a local acceptance timestamp. It does
not contain a maintainer signature or claim independent release provenance.

The owner surface is intentionally narrow:

```text
sudo open-mmi-trust-state status
sudo open-mmi-trust-state accept-current
```

`accept-current` accepts no candidate path, repository, URL, command or non-interactive
confirmation flag. On a machine with no prior accepted state it can bootstrap only the exact
currently installed Trust Manifest after an interactive digest-bound confirmation. Once
state exists, the command may refresh it only when the installed boundary is equivalent or
narrower. The underlying state mutation primitive independently enforces the same monotonic
rule, so reusing it cannot broaden existing accepted authority or accept a policy-generation
regression. Trust Transition Gate v1 provides the separate old-trusted-side pre-install
acknowledgement path for an exact prepared expansion; `accept-current` remains unable to do so
after candidate installation.

The reusable comparison function applies these v1 rules capability by capability:

- a candidate policy may not rank above the accepted policy;
- for `declared-purposes-only`, candidate purposes must be a subset of accepted purposes;
- candidate assurance must be equal or stronger; weakening assurance is a trust expansion;
- a lower `policy_generation` is blocked as a generation regression until trusted downgrade
  lineage exists;
- equal or narrower authority is marked safe to proceed without new owner acknowledgement;
  an expansion is marked as requiring an old-side owner acknowledgement.

Trust Inspector v1 reads this state without mutation. Missing state remains `UNVERIFIED`; an
invalid state file or an installed manifest that exceeds/regresses the accepted ceiling is a
`FAIL`; an equal or narrower installed manifest is `PASS` for the accepted-state check. CI
also rejects normal Open MMI production code that mutates accepted state: the raw writer is
module-internal and the local owner CLI may call only the monotonic record primitive.

This is still software enforcement on a privileged machine. Arbitrary root software can
replace Open MMI or its local state. Installed-file integrity, append-only transition lineage,
pinned release provenance and independent checker implementations now exist as separate
evidence layers. The independent checker can be run against a mounted target with an
owner-supplied signer fingerprint and optional checker/lineage anchors, but those software
layers do not make an arbitrary-root system hardware-attested or intrinsically immutable.

## Trust Transition Gate v1

The update rule is now enforced for prepared Nightly candidates:

> Software may surrender authority without special permission. It may not silently acquire
> authority that the already-trusted installation did not possess.

The gate runs in installed trusted code before candidate-controlled privileged deployment. A
prepared candidate remains data while the decision is made. The candidate Trust Manifest is
read from the exact candidate commit with trusted `git ls-tree` and `git cat-file` operations;
the gate does not import candidate Python, execute candidate shell, load candidate package
metadata, or invoke candidate hooks to determine the trust relation. The manifest must be a
non-executable regular Git blob, is size-bounded, decoded as strict UTF-8 JSON, and is validated
with the installed manifest schema.

The coordinator performs a preflight check before it starts the root installer service, and the
installer independently repeats the check immediately before deployment. The resulting rules
are:

- missing or invalid Accepted Owner Trust State blocks installation;
- a policy-generation regression blocks installation;
- an equal or narrower candidate may proceed without new owner acknowledgement;
- an expansion remains prepared but blocked until the owner acknowledges that exact transition
  through installed trusted code.

The owner surface is deliberately fixed:

```text
sudo open-mmi-trust-transition status
sudo open-mmi-trust-transition acknowledge
```

It accepts no candidate path, repository, ref, URL, manifest path, command, `--yes`, or other
non-interactive bypass. Expansion acknowledgement requires a local interactive terminal and a
confirmation phrase bound to the candidate manifest digest and candidate commit. The resulting
root-private authorization record is additionally bound to the prepared transaction ID, exact
candidate commit, current accepted-state digest, accepted manifest digest, candidate manifest
digest, and candidate policy generation. A new preparation or a changed accepted state makes
the authorization stale.

For an acknowledged expansion, installed trusted code records the newly accepted capability
ceiling before candidate root code receives that expanded authority, then consumes the exact
transition authorization. For an equal or narrower transition, accepted owner state advances
only after deployment succeeds; this avoids a failed narrowing followed by rollback leaving the
restored older software outside the accepted ceiling.

After the gate succeeds, the existing deployment engine still executes the prepared candidate's
`scripts/manage.sh _deploy-prepared` as root. That execution is intentionally *after* the trust
decision and must never be moved before it. Trust Transition Gate v1 constrains official update
flow and owner acknowledgement; it is not an OS sandbox against arbitrary root software or a
proof that a candidate's manifest is truthful. Generation 6 now includes specific OS-level
boundaries and independent verification paths, but those are separately scoped evidence and do
not turn the transition gate into a general sandbox or make a candidate's declaration self-proving.

A maintainer signature proves provenance only when old trusted code can authenticate it to a
signer identity the owner independently established. It still does not grant permission to silently
redraw an owner's accepted trust boundary. Trust Transition Lineage v1 records local accepted-state
changes, Installed Release/File Integrity v1 binds current runtime bytes to the exact accepted Git
candidate, and Release Provenance v1 verifies that exact commit against a pinned signer root. Their
genesis baselines do not retroactively prove earlier history, and arbitrary root can still replace
installed code plus local trust state. Externally grounded conclusions therefore still require
verification from outside the inspected runtime. The independent checker provides that path when
the operator supplies independent signer/checker/lineage anchors; it does not by itself create a
hardware or immutable off-device attestation root.

## Trust Transition Lineage v1

Trust Transition Lineage v1 records accepted-owner-trust state changes separately from the
mutable Accepted Owner Trust State itself. Production lineage is a root-owned mode `0700`
directory:

```text
/var/lib/open-mmi/trust/transition-lineage.v1.d
```

Each record is a mode `0600` regular file whose name contains its zero-padded sequence number
and the SHA-256 digest of its canonical record bytes. Official code appends by creating a new
record; it never rewrites, truncates, renumbers, or replaces an existing record. Every record
after the baseline contains the previous record digest, accepted-state before/after digests,
manifest before/after digests and generations, the full post-transition accepted-state snapshot,
the recomputed transition relation/changes, the decision source, candidate transaction/commit
when applicable, and whether local owner acknowledgement was required. Expansion records also
bind the transition-authorization digest.

The chain has two anchors. Record validation recomputes each record digest and the semantic
manifest comparison against the previous record, while the current Accepted Owner Trust State
must exactly match the final record's accepted-state snapshot and digest. Consequently editing
or reordering a record fails the hash chain, and deleting the newest authority-changing record
leaves a valid shorter chain whose head no longer matches current accepted authority and therefore
fails inspection and blocks future prepared updates. This remains local software evidence: an
arbitrary root attacker capable of replacing both stores still needs an independent external
integrity anchor to be detected.

Existing installations establish an explicit genesis baseline with:

```text
sudo open-mmi-trust-lineage status
sudo open-mmi-trust-lineage bootstrap
```

Bootstrap requires a local interactive, accepted-state-digest-bound confirmation and records
`history_before_baseline: unverified`. It does not claim that the historical generation-1 to
generation-2 transition or any earlier install was lineage-recorded. New accepted-state bootstrap
performed by `open-mmi-trust-state accept-current` creates the Lineage v1 baseline in the same
local owner flow.

If accepted state was successfully written but the following lineage append could not complete
(for example because of a filesystem failure), the mismatch is deliberately fail-closed. The
updater will not treat the newer accepted state as sufficient authority while lineage is behind.
A local owner can inspect and append reconciliation evidence with:

```text
sudo open-mmi-trust-lineage reconcile-current
```

Reconciliation never rewrites history or changes accepted authority. It appends a record only
after local confirmation; if the current state is an expansion beyond the lineage head, matching
transition-authorization evidence is additionally required. There is intentionally no silent or
candidate-controlled repair path.

For an acknowledged prepared expansion, old trusted code changes Accepted Owner Trust State,
appends the exact expansion lineage record, and only then allows candidate-controlled deployment
to continue. The one-shot transition authorization is consumed only after both accepted state and
lineage have advanced. For a non-expanding candidate whose accepted manifest changes, accepted
state and lineage advance only after deployment succeeds. A candidate with an identical accepted
manifest produces no redundant authority-transition record.

## Installed Release/File Integrity v1

Installed Release/File Integrity v1 closes a different gap from the Trust Manifest and Transition
Gate: after an update decision, it answers whether the runtime bytes actually active on the system
still match the exact candidate Git tree that old trusted code accepted. It does **not** turn Git
ancestry into signer authentication and it does not give a candidate permission to expand trust.

Production integrity state is a root-owned mode `0600` regular file beneath the existing private
mode `0700` trust directory:

```text
/var/lib/open-mmi/trust/installed-release-integrity.v1.json
```

The state records the exact 40-hex candidate commit, embedded Trust Manifest and digest, a sorted
canonical runtime-file inventory and inventory digest, and the Accepted Owner Trust State plus
Lineage-head digests current when that integrity state was recorded. Inventory entries bind each
logical runtime path to its byte length and SHA-256 digest. Validation rejects duplicate JSON
fields, non-finite values, unknown fields, symlinked/weakened production state, duplicate paths,
non-canonical ordering and digest mismatches.

The expected inventory is derived with old trusted code from the exact Git commit objects using
`git ls-tree`/`git cat-file`; candidate Python is never imported or executed to describe itself.
Only explicitly supported runtime file kinds and Git modes are accepted. A candidate that adds an
unrecognized runtime artifact such as a native `.so`, symlink or submodule fails closed until the
trusted inventory policy is deliberately updated and reviewed. Build cache files such as
`__pycache__`/`.pyc` are ignored because they are derived runtime artifacts, and the dashboard's
source-only `ui/web_dashboard/README.md` is explicitly outside the executable/runtime inventory.

### The active runtime is intentionally verified in two physical places

Open MMI does not have one physical runtime root. User services run with
`WorkingDirectory=/opt/open-mmi`, so imports for `actions`, `bindings`, `canbusd`, `powerd`, `ui`
and `vehicles` are satisfied by the deployed source tree. Root/system update services and console
entry points execute the installed wheel from the venv, so `open_mmi_trust`,
`open_mmi_telemetry`, and wheel-installed copies of the runtime packages live in
`site-packages`. File Integrity v1 verifies both locations against the same logical Git-object
inventory. A one-root check would be incomplete and is treated as a trust defect.

### Establishing the first local baseline

An existing installation can establish File Integrity v1 locally with:

```text
sudo open-mmi-trust-integrity status
sudo open-mmi-trust-integrity bootstrap
```

Bootstrap requires root plus an interactive TTY, requires current Accepted Owner Trust State and
Lineage to be valid, rejects a generation regression or an installed manifest broader than the
accepted ceiling, and requires an exact confirmation phrase bound to the first 12 hex characters
of the candidate inventory digest. A managed checkout must identify one exact committed tree; a
dirty editable checkout is refused rather than silently attributing uncommitted bytes to a Git
commit. The bootstrap summary explicitly states `history_before_baseline: unverified`; the stored
state identifies its source as `baseline-existing-state`. Together those semantics establish
evidence from that exact point forward and do not retroactively attest earlier installations.

### Prepared-update ordering

Once Release Provenance v1 is established, a managed prepared update is ordered so identity,
provenance, authority, and bytes remain separate checks:

1. require the **currently installed** split runtime to match its existing integrity state and bind
   that integrity commit to the managed source's recorded `installed_commit`;
2. verify the current integrity-bound commit signature offline against the pinned signer root;
3. verify the exact prepared candidate commit signature offline against the same pinned signer root;
4. re-evaluate the Trust Transition Gate against current Accepted Owner Trust State and Lineage;
5. derive the candidate Trust Manifest and runtime inventory from the exact candidate Git objects;
6. for an acknowledged expansion, advance the already-defined accepted-state/lineage authority
   transition only after the provenance, integrity, and trust-boundary checks succeed;
7. only after those old-trusted decisions, invoke the candidate wheel build with the already-installed
   Python/pip into the root-owned transaction rollback tree. A PEP 517 build backend is
   candidate-controlled code, so this build is deliberately the first candidate-controlled execution
   point and must never move before steps 1–6;
8. verify the resulting wheel's complete logical runtime payload against the Git-object inventory;
9. pass `scripts/manage.sh _deploy-prepared` only that exact transaction-bound, root-owned wheel;
10. after deployment and service health checks, verify both active runtime locations against the
    exact candidate inventory;
11. finalize an equal/narrower accepted-state transition where needed, then atomically record the
    new integrity state.

The candidate therefore cannot silently choose a different Python package artifact after being
accepted. The wheel build itself may execute candidate-controlled PEP 517 backend code, but only
after old trusted code has completed the boundary decision and, for an acknowledged expansion,
advanced accepted authority plus lineage. The build output is not trusted merely because it built:
it must match the Git-object inventory before `manage.sh` receives it. Missing or mismatched current
integrity blocks later prepared updates; a post-deployment mismatch is a failed update and no new
integrity baseline is recorded. The current deployment engine still runs the accepted candidate's
`scripts/manage.sh _deploy-prepared` after the old-side gate and wheel verification, so this is not
yet a fully old-code-owned filesystem deployment engine. Also, a failure detected by the outer installer after candidate deployment returns may
leave candidate bytes present while the updater remains failed and integrity state is not
advanced; future work can move final file replacement/rollback entirely into the trusted
installer. Those limitations must not be described as atomic attestation.

### Integrity is not provenance

Trust Inspector exposes two separate conclusions:

- `release.file-integrity` can be `PASS` when strict local state is valid and all active bytes
  match the recorded accepted Git candidate;
- `release.provenance` can be `PASS` only when a separately established pinned signer root is valid
  and the integrity-bound commit has one valid OpenPGP signature chaining to that exact root.

This separation is intentional. A Git commit ID and matching bytes identify content; forward
ancestry identifies history in the repository object graph. Neither statement by itself answers
which signer the owner independently trusts. Provenance supplies that signer identity; it still does
not authorize a capability expansion.

## Release Provenance / Pinned Signer Root v1

Release Provenance v1 adds a local signer-authentication root without changing Trust Manifest
policy generation. Production state is a create-once root-owned mode `0600` file beneath the
existing private trust directory:

```text
/var/lib/open-mmi/trust/release-signer-root.v1.json
```

The state records one owner-pinned OpenPGP primary fingerprint, the signing-capable fingerprints
present in the reviewed public-key material, the canonical public-key bytes and SHA-256 digest,
the exact integrity-bound baseline commit, the baseline integrity-state digest, and
`history_before_baseline: unverified`. Unknown fields, duplicate JSON fields, non-finite values,
weakened permissions, key/digest disagreement, or malformed fingerprints fail closed. Official v1
code has no root replacement or signer-rotation primitive.

### Offline signature verification

Old trusted code verifies commits with fixed `/usr/bin/git` and `/usr/bin/gpg` executables. Those
files and their containing system directory must themselves be root-controlled regular/executable
paths with no group/other write permission. Verification creates a fresh mode `0700` temporary GPG
home containing only the pinned public key, disables system/global Git configuration, sets no
keyserver or automatic key retrieval, and runs `git verify-commit --raw`. Exactly one valid
signature must be reported; its signing fingerprint must be one of the pinned key's signing-capable
fingerprints and its primary fingerprint must equal the pinned primary. GitHub's `Verified` badge,
the caller's personal keyring, Web-of-Trust ownertrust, repository ancestry, and network key
discovery are not accepted as signer roots.

Because v1 pins an exact reviewed public-key snapshot, it deliberately does not auto-adopt newly
created signing subkeys, expiry extensions, revocation material, or a replacement primary key. A
future signer/key update requires a separately designed owner-visible trust transition. Until then,
a key lifecycle change can intentionally make updates fail closed rather than silently changing who
may sign releases.

### Establishing the signer root

After the provenance-capable release is installed and File Integrity v1 records that exact release,
the owner can inspect and pin a locally supplied public key:

```text
sudo open-mmi-trust-provenance status
sudo open-mmi-trust-provenance bootstrap --key-file /path/to/reviewed-release-key.asc
```

Bootstrap requires root and a local interactive TTY, requires current File Integrity v1 to match,
verifies that the integrity-bound commit is already signed by the proposed key, and requires the
exact confirmation `PIN RELEASE SIGNER <FULL_PRIMARY_FINGERPRINT>`. The full fingerprint must be
verified through an independent owner/auditor channel before confirmation. The CLI re-reads the key,
active integrity state, repository identity, and signature after confirmation before create-once
persistence. It accepts public key material only and rejects symlinked key-file input.

The first provenance baseline is deliberately non-retroactive. In particular, Release Provenance
v1 cannot honestly claim that the update which first installed the provenance verifier was itself
pre-install provenance-gated. That release must be installed by the already-established Integrity,
Transition Gate, and Lineage path while the old runtime still matches its recorded integrity state;
then the signer root is pinned against the newly installed, integrity-bound signed commit.

For development systems where the integrity-bound checkout is also the active runtime, do not patch
that live checkout in place to introduce Provenance v1. Build and sign the candidate in a separate
worktree/clone, push it, then let the existing old-trusted prepared updater install it. Re-baselining
integrity after directly replacing the protected runtime would erase the very continuity this layer
is intended to preserve.

Once the root exists, future prepared updates fail closed unless **both** the currently installed
integrity commit and the exact candidate commit verify against that root before the Trust Transition
Gate and before any candidate-controlled PEP 517 build/deployment begins.

Arbitrary privileged code can still replace the installed verifier and local signer/integrity state,
so local `release.provenance: PASS` is not an external attestation. The independent Trust Checker
can carry or independently obtain the reviewed signer root and verify release lineage and installed
evidence without importing the target Open MMI package, including against a target filesystem
mounted from rescue/live media.

## SI and downstream distributions

Open MMI does not attempt to prevent a system integrator or owner with control of a machine
from running different software. The goal is narrower: a modified installation should not
silently inherit Open MMI's trust reputation after removing or weakening the controls that
support that reputation.

Trust Inspection and the independent verifier therefore evaluate demonstrated capabilities,
evidence provenance and lineage rather than simply checking whether an installation has an
official Open MMI file hash.

## Trust Inspector v1

Trust Inspector v1 is a read-only local evidence surface. It does not authorize a
capability, modify telemetry consent, contact a network service, or change the Trust Manifest.
Run it with:

```text
open-mmi-trust-inspect
open-mmi-trust-inspect --json
```

The machine-readable report contract is checked in at:

```text
open_mmi_trust/data/trust-inspection.v1.schema.json
```

Inspection results use three deliberately different states:

- `PASS` — one concrete local check succeeded;
- `FAIL` — observed local state contradicts the inspected trust contract;
- `UNVERIFIED` — the current architecture cannot prove the claim.

`UNVERIFIED` must never be presented as equivalent to `PASS`. The default human command
therefore exits successfully when no contradiction was found, while `--require-pass` can be
used by a stricter local checker that wants any remaining unverified evidence to be
non-zero. A `FAIL` is always non-zero.

V1 reports the strict Trust Manifest parse, policy generation and deterministic manifest
self-digest; every declared capability and assurance level; Accepted Owner Trust State and
the installed manifest's relation to that accepted ceiling; redacted Telemetry Guard
authorization state and exact authorized scope when readable; a no-authorization runtime
probe that verifies telemetry sampling does not begin before the guard; installed-source
tripwires preventing normal Open MMI production code from calling telemetry or accepted-state
mutation primitives; the current CAN no-send source tripwire; and the dashboard's local
Bootstrap / no-remote-render-dependency contract. VIN salt and fingerprint bytes are
intentionally not part of the inspection report schema.

The inspector also states what it cannot currently prove. In generation 6 it distinguishes
declared policy from reviewed static contracts and deployed configuration. For
`network.external-egress`, `vehicle-data.persistence`, `vehicle.can.transmit` and
`vehicle.identity.remote-resolution`, production checks can validate the applicable source,
root-owned deployed unit/udev/storage and privilege contracts, but those results do not directly
observe every effective process action, network packet, filesystem write, CAN namespace/qdisc
state or hardware property. Missing deployed evidence remains `UNVERIFIED`; a contradiction or
weakened contract is `FAIL`. Live CAN topology is measured separately by the independent P02 CAN
checker and is not folded into the local Inspector PASS.

Accepted owner release trust state is inspectable once locally bootstrapped, and Trust Inspector v1
reproduces the source-level ordering of Trust Transition Gate v1: coordinator preflight before
installer launch, installer recheck before candidate deployment, and Git-object candidate-manifest
inspection. Trust Transition Lineage v1 is inspected as a hash-chained local record and becomes
`PASS` once a locally confirmed baseline exists and its head anchors current accepted state.
Installed Release/File Integrity v1 can make `release.file-integrity` `PASS` once its locally
confirmed baseline exists and both active runtime roots match it. `release.provenance` remains
`UNVERIFIED` until a Release Provenance v1 signer root is locally established; after bootstrap it
becomes `PASS` only when the integrity-bound commit verifies against that exact pinned root. An
overall `UNVERIFIED` result can therefore still be correct when a required evidence dimension is
unavailable; a static/deployed PASS never hides missing live or hardware evidence.

That limitation is intentional. The built-in inspector is evidence produced by the installed
software itself; File Integrity v1 plus a pinned signer root make byte drift and signer mismatch
detectable relative to local anchors, but sufficiently privileged modified software can replace the
inspector and those local anchors together. The independent Trust Checker now provides the
separate verifier path: it can use an independently reviewed signer fingerprint and inspect the
target without importing its Open MMI package. Externally retained signer/checker/lineage anchors
strengthen that conclusion, while hardware qualification and immutable off-device attestation
remain separate questions.
